polynomials:


NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

We can specify the x and Y axis start and end points using Numpy

We can create a graph for specified values using matplotlib.pyplot

A decorator in Python is any callable Python object that is used to modify a function or a class. A reference to a function "func" or a class "C" is passed to a decorator and the decorator returns a modified function or class. The modified functions or classes usually contain calls to the original function "func" or class "C"
 
We can create the polynomial function using "def __call__()"

We can add and subtract two polynomial functions using  "__add__"," __sub__" and "generator" methods.
